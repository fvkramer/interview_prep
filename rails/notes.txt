PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

High Level -> C/C++ -> Assembly -> Binary

Interpreted                                   Compiled
source code is the program (scripts)          produces program written in Assembly
scripts portable. Different interpreters      compiled language architecture specific to machine's
act diff. Unix shells reaed each statment     platform. 
and send result. Perl first entire file       FASTER than interpreted, however might need
Slower, easier to debug. JS, Python           to recompile on other machines
Any comp can run with appropriate 
interpreter


Intermediate to Computer-specific compiled programs are designed for runtime environments
Java example. Similar to compiled language, but source code => byte code
for runtime environment's "virtual machine".
"VM" interprets byte code => computer specific commands

Advantage - runtime environment only compiles needed pieces of code. 'just-in-time compiling'
Disad - poorly designed code -> runtime environment compiling all code.  


Statically Typed - (verifying and enforcing contraints) at compile time
Dynamically Typed = type checking at run time

Duck Typing - determines if an object can be used for a particular purpose

DB:

TCO - total cost of ownership

Relational vs Non Relational
Postgresql  -   MongoDB


Relational (Relational Databas Management System)

Stores data in rows and columns

Theory/Purpose of Non Relational
  - build upon relational DB. Incorporate NoSQL innovations for modern applications

Strengths of Relational DB:
  - suppor relational algebra and have foreign keys, joins, and multi-row transactions
    - NoSQL does not have
  - expressive query language and secondary indexes
    - secondary indexes supported natively by database
  - strong consistency
    - immediately read what's written to database
  - enterprise management and integration

Lacking/NoSQL offers:
  - Flexible data model
    - allows flexible data columns in database
  - Scalability and Performance
    - includes sharding and/or partioning
      - allows scaling on commodity hardware -> unlim. growth with higher throughput and lower latency
        - throughput = amount of data passing through system
        - latency - delay between transfer of data and instruction to transfer
  - designed for highly available systes. replication to auto synch data across servers,rack, and data centers



NoSQL does not have all capabilities that relational DB has.
MongoDB incorporates NoSQL with SQL



DB Theory

Integrity of Data important. RDBMS supports ACID
(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

Atomicity - indivisible and irreducible transaction that is all or nothing
    - atomicity guarantee means no partial DB updates

Consistency - db transaction changes affected data in ways adhering to DB rules/data constraints
Isolation - determines how transaction integrity visible to other users and systems
  - if user creates purchase order but not purchase order lines, is header available to all other users?
    - Lower Isolation allows many users to access the same data at the same time
      - increases number of concurrency effects (such as dirty reads or lost updates) users may encounter
  - Higher isolation level reduces types of concurrency effects users may encounter, but requires more system resources 
  and increases chance one transaction blocks another

Durability - guarantees that committed transactions persists
  - for ex. if someone books a seat on a flight, then seat booked even if system crashes


Due to exponential growth of data in past decade, needed different DB theory/model


No single software that is NoSQL
  over 200 projects that fall into NoSQL category
  each project diff. strengths and weakness

Cons
- no common standardized query language 
- NoSQL db do not enforce data constraints in server. Developers have to code them
- No ACID properties
- No data modeling. Limits type of queries that can be run efficiently
- Security flaws. As more features added, "simplicity" decreases
- So many products -> harder to decide which one to use

Populat NoSQL DB:
  - MongodDB, Cassandra, Redis


Misc/Key Terms/Vocab

Runtime - software/instructions executed while program running
        - instructions I did not write specifically
        - Low-level languages like C have small runtimes. Higher level language like
        - Obj C have extensive runtime.
        ---Code to implement features of language itself

Sharding - break database into smaller chunks, "shards" and spread across
          number of servers -> bettter scaling

    Theory 
      - growth DB transactions and volumes large impact on response times
      - DB relies on CPU, Memory, Data
      - Reach limits on single server. send to multiple

Indexing - optimizes performance by minimizing number of disk access required
        for query processing.
        - database index is an ordered structure to quickly locate and access data in DB table
        - indexes created with database columns
          - first column Search key that contains primary key of table
          - second column reference to disk block 
      - O (log N)
